<li>
    **Nexus Companion: Emotion-Labeled Dataset for Empathetic LLMs** (EMNLP Submission)  <br>
    Lead researcher for NexusCompanion, a scalable benchmark for multi-label emotion classification in LLMs.  Curated 100K Reddit conversations labeled using Plutchik's Emotion Model for emotional alignment.  Fine-tuned models with Hugging Face, LoRA, and GPT-4; optimized for inference efficiency and fairness.  Collaborating with Dr. Sumon Biswas and Dr. Max Han.  Submitted to EMNLP 2025.

    **Advancements in Counterfactual Explainability with GNNs** <br/>
    Developing dynamic graph neural network methods for counterfactual explanation in LLMs and deep models.  Focus on symbolic interpretability, static analysis, and causal graph modeling.  Advisor: Dr. Jing Ma.

<li>
    **Region-Specific LLMs with Fairness-Aware LORA Optimization** <br/>
    Designed fine-tuning techniques for bias mitigation in LLMs across dialects and regional language variants.  Benchmarked fairness with contrastive prompts and symbolic consistency checks. 
</li>
<li>
    **Trustworthy AI and Formal Fairness Research** <br/>
    Contributed to formal fairness testing pipelines for ML models.  Surveyed 75+ papers across symbolic, formal, and empirical fairness auditing frameworks.
